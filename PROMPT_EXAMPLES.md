## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Step-by-Step Testing
1. **Start with obviously good prompts** (legitimate business offers)
2. **Test borderline cases** (promotional content that might seem suspicious)
3. **Try clearly bad prompts** (political, gambling, adult content)
4. **Test mixed content** (good offer + bad element)

### Expected Classification Results
- ‚úÖ **"Promotional"** - Should be allowed
- ‚úÖ **"Informational"** - Should be allowed  
- ‚ùå **"Political"** - Should be blocked
- ‚ùå **"Fraud"** - Should be blocked
- ‚ùå **"Adult"** - Should be blocked
- ‚ùå **"Gambling"** - Should be blocked
- ‚ùå **"Illegal"** - Should be blocked

### Mixed Content Examples (For Advanced Testing)
